Claims: 
• Age must be >= to 18 on the outpt visit date. 
• If med reconciliation is reported > once for an inpt discharge (utilizing Part B claims), the most favorable QDC(s) reported w/in 30 days after the discharge should count for the episode for performance calculations.
• The 30 day episode will start 30 days minus the 1st expense date of an outpt visit where a denom code is present on the claim’s line item. If multiple outpt visits appear (where denom codes are on multiple line items) on the same claim take the denom code line item with the latest expense date (of the denom codes that fall within 30-days of the inpt. discharge  on that claim).
•  Hospital (inpt Part B discharge) ""hidden"" codes are at the bene-level regardless of TIN/NPI. Correlate eligible cases with non-denom inpt codes for bene regardless of TIN/NPI to find last inpt expense date, then count 30 days per episode from that date.
• Inpt discharges may occur up to 30 days prior to the beginning of the performance period (January 1, 2017), but outpt visits must occur during the reporting period (January 1 - December 31, 2017).                                                                                                                                                    • Take the last inpt expense date of the line item for the relevant “hidden” inpatient codes when multiple inpt codes are submitted on consecutive days or when one inpt code spans several expense dates, the last date should count as the date of inpt discharge.                                                                                                                                                    • The last inpt discharge during the 30 day episode will override any previous inpt discharges. 
• If the outpatient visit occurs during the hospital visit (same day as an inpatient code is submitted), then it will not count as an instance of reporting. An outpatient visit must occur at least one day AFTER an inpatient discharge (break in inpatient codes) to count as an instance of reporting.
• REFER TO THE ""HIDDEN CODES"" TAB OF THE SINGLE SOURCE FOR A COMPLETE LISTING OF THE HOSPITAL INPATIENT DISCHARGE ""HIDDEN"" CODES
